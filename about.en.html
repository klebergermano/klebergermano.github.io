    <h2>About this Blog</h2>

    <p>This blog is a personal project where I put some studies and experiencies with programming. 
        The mainly purpose here is to organize what I have been learning in this years, while 
        I keep some useful code and tutorials to be checked later which I too hope it could be useful 
        to others.
    </p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm self-tauth programer which have his first contact with programming in 2009 when I began to "look" 
        in HMTL and CSS code, efectively I start to study in 2011 including some scripts in JS and JQuery,
        in 2013 I start to properly learning about programming with PHP and how Data base worked with MySQL, 
        and get some little websites to do, In 2015 to 2018, I give some time to it, besides never trully 
        stop, but foccuses more in design skills as Premiere, Photoshop, and Illustrator as a requirement
        of my work as design of layout in a print shop, in the late 2018 I get back with more foccus in Vanilla JS, 
        and Node, wich was a shock how good it could be use "pure" JS even in Backend. Since all these I have used 
        CakePHP (which I regreat, after some headached, I should had choosed Laravel), ReactJS, Electron and more
        recently Jekyll.</p>
