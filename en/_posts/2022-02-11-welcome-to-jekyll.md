Welcome to my blog content: Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. <!--more--> You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.


Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`
